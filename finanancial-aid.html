        Hello, my name is "your name" and I live in "your country", 
        the country in development. I'm applying for Financial Aid for the course "Course name" because I do not have any special source of income and I don't earn enough money and I can't afford the full tuition at this time of my life and career. 
        Receiving Financial Aid for this course will help me get valuable knowledge in "write your career neme like machine learening" , 
        and i searching for a job from a long time for earning money for taking this course, and i not find yet, 
        and the time goes on, and receiving financial aid will allow me to focus on my studies and 
        by taking it to allow to take off a paid internship and can take 
        another course in machine learning path . I want to invest in my career and 
        my education, but at this moment I can only invest my time to increase my knowledge and advance in my career 
        and not the money. Hopefully this will change in the upcoming years 
        because I'm ambitious, I want to increase my programming knowledge and new technologies, 
        I'm eager to work and to advance in my career.
